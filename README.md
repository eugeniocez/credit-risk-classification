## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the prediction of credit risk with machine learning models. The financial data analyzied included variables such as: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. The main goal of this analysis is to predict the loan status, which helps indicate whether a loan is healthy of high-risk.

The machine learning process involved multiple stages:

1. Preprocessing the data
2. Training the model
3. Evaluating the model
